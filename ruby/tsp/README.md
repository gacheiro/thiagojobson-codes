# Travelling Salesman Problem
Exact implementation of the Travelling Salesman Problem.

The algorithm naively enumerates all possible routes and calculates the best one.

## How to run
```
ruby tsp.rb
=> Best route found:
=> Node<x=-15, y=20>, Node<x=-10, y=10>, Node<x=0, y=0>, Node<x=0, y=-5>, Node<x=5, y=0>, Node<x=10, y=5>, Node<x=15, y=10>, Node<x=25, y=-20>, Node<x=30, y=0>, Node<x=42, y=42>
=> Avaliation:
=> 145
```
